Machine Learning Lab Assignment: Simple Linear Regression

# Question 1:
Implement Linear Regression and calculate sum of residual error on the following
Datasets.

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

y = [1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 12]
* Compute the regression coefficients using analytic formulation and calculate Sum
Squared Error (SSE) and $R^2$ value.
* Implement gradient descent (both Full-batch and Stochastic with stopping
criteria) on Least Mean Square loss formulation to compute the coefficients of
regression matrix and compare the results using performance measures such as $R^2$,
SSE etc.

# Question 2:
Download Boston Housing Rate Dataset. Analyse the input attributes and find out the
attribute that best follow the linear relationship with the output price. Implement both the
analytic formulation and gradient descent (Full-batch, stochastic) on LMS loss
formulation to compute the coefficients of regression matrix and compare the results.
